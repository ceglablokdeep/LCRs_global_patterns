##This folder contains a directory aln_files_and_trees which contains a directory alnfiles_trees having all the aln files and species trees ##184271 aln files and 184271 trees
##making conf files for PAML to calculate separate omegas for each branch
###to calculate free omega for each branch in the tree using PAML, it is necessary to make model = 1; fix_omega = 0. You can use CodonFreq = 2 as codon frequency table (F3X4).
##I have made a demo control file with necessary parameters to run free ratio using PAML, I will use this file to run PAML on all the aln files.
cp demo.ctl ../aln_files_and_trees/alnfiles_trees/
cd /path/to/alnfiles_trees
ls |grep ".nwk" > inputfilenames  ##184271
