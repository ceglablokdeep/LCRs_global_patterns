###The birds tree was downloaded from Birdtree.org with 1000 bootstraps and is processed using sumtrees.py
grep "tree_" output.nex |awk '{print $4}' > onlytrees.nwk
sumtrees.py --rooted --ultrametric --ultrametricity-precision 10000 onlytrees.nwk > birds_mrc.tre
cat birds_mrc.tre |sed -e 's/\[[^][]*\]//g' > bird_mrc_tree_cleaned.tre
tail -n3 bird_mrc_tree_cleaned.tre |head -n1|awk '{print $4}' > birds_final.tre
cp birds_final.tre aves_list.nwk
sed -i 's/1.00000000//g' aves_list.nwk

##All the remaining species tree for clades were downloaded from TimeTree.org and are saved as "clade"_list.nwk
##NOTE: if the tree happen to have internode labels (denoted by numbers in single quotes), then remove them as PAML make its own internode labels
for t in `ls *_list.nwk`
do
sed -e "s/'[^()]*'//g" "$t" > temp.nwk
mv temp.nwk "$t"
done


###After the above cleaning, you can run the following script to get the unrooted trees:
for i in `ls *nwk`
do
j=`echo $i|sed 's/.nwk/_unrooted.nwk/g'`
echo 'library(ape)'  > unroot_tree.r
echo 'a<-read.tree("'$i'")' >> unroot_tree.r
echo 'b<-unroot(a)' >> unroot_tree.r
echo 'write.tree(b,file="'$j'")' >> unroot_tree.r
Rscript unroot_tree.r
done
